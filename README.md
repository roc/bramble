Bramble
=========

Is a tool which helps you safely upgrade your [NPM](http://npmjs.org)
dependencies.

Running Bramble will look at each dependency in your package.json, and one by
one will ask if you want to update that dependency. If you let it, Bramble will
then download the latest version of that dependency, optionally (with the
--test flag) running your test suite to check for any breaking changes in the
new version. Finally, Bramble will (with the --save flag) write the new version
to your package.json.

He's also my cat.
